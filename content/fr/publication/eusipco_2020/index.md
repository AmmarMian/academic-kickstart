abstract: In recent years, the use of Riemannian geometry has reportedly shown an increased performance for machine learning problems whose features lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. The present paper aims at reviewing several approaches based on this paradigm and provide a reproducible comparison of their output on a classic learning task of pedestrian detection. Notably, the robustness of these approaches to corrupted data will be assessed.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Comparative study SPD machine learning.
