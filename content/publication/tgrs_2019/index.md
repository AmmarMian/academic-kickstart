abstract: High resolution in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) leads to new physical characterizations of scatterers which are anisotropic and dispersive. These behaviors present an interesting source of diversity for target detection schemes. Unfortunately, such characteristics have been integrated and have been naturally lost in monovariate single-look SAR images. Modeling this behavior as nonstationarity, wavelet analysis has been successful in retrieving this information. However, the sharp-edge of the used wavelet functions introduces undesired high side-lobes for the strong scatterers present in the images. In this paper, a new family of parameterized wavelets, designed specifically to reduce those side lobes in the SAR image decomposition, is proposed. Target detection schemes are then explored using this spectro-angular diversity and it can be shown that in high-resolution SAR images, the non-Gaussian and robust framework leads to better results.
