abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for Change Detection between two monovariate complex SAR images. Linear Time-Frequency tools are used in order to recover a spectral and angular diversity of the scatterers present in the scene. This diversity is used in bi-date change detection framework to develop a detector, whose performances are better than the classic detector on monovariate SAR images.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
